# Preliminary Discussion
1. **Final Goal:** aiming for a real-time robotic navigation system and a simulation based on
real world data.
2. **Hardware Considerations:** We can go for Nvidia Jetsons, STM's. Neuromorphic
hardware is not in plans for now.
3. **Evaluation Metrics:** Focusing on efficiency, accuracy, power consumption, real-time
mapping and navigation capabilities,
4. **Event Camera Integration:** current plan was to plan to use event cameras alone.
5. **Implementation Level:** Would like guidance on algorithm design only and implementation
details (e.g., frameworks, programming languages, datasets) as well.
## Following is a comprehensive breakdown on how to develop an end-to-end 3D SLAM algorithm using a bio-inspired approach and event camera data. 
1. **Stage-by-stage Developmental Breakdown:** From conceptual design to real-time
implementation.
2. **Key Research Areas:** Biological inspiration sources (ants, locusts, sweat bees, C.
elegans, etc.), event-based vision, and SLAM methodologies.
3. **Algorithmic Design:** How to model navigation principles from biological systems.
4. **Implementation Details:** Suitable frameworks, programming languages, and datasets.
5. **Hardware Considerations:** Optimizing for Nvidia Jetsons, STM hardware constraints.
6. **Evaluation Metrics:** Measuring efficiency, accuracy, power consumption, and real-time
performance.
