Inspired by the paper: [Neuromorphic sequence learning with an event camera on routes through vegetation](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/scirobotics.adg3679) 

The dataset used is [DSEC: A Stereo Event Camera Dataset for Driving
Scenarios](https://dsec.ifi.uzh.ch)

Aim: To use ant brain morphology(Kenton Cells, Mushroom Bodies) to develop a visual Place recognition algorithm to aid the SLAM framework.
