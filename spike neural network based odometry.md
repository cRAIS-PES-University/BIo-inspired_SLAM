1. **Neural Network Architecture**:  use a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) that utilizes the Spike Response Model (SRM) for temporal dynamics. The network will have several convolutional layers configured to process spatiotemporal data effectively, modeled after the structure in the `cnn_avg_fc1.py` script combined with principles from the `base.py`.

2. **Data Handling**: We'll integrate the handling of both event data and optical flow data. This involves preprocessing the data to fit the input requirements of the SNN, ensuring that event data is converted using voxel grids or similar techniques and optical flow is processed to provide motion cues.

3. **Training**: The model will be trained in two stages:
   - **Stage 1**: Combined training using both event data and optical flow to leverage spatial and temporal dynamics fully.
   - **Stage 2**: Refinement using only event data to enhance the model's efficiency and effectiveness in dynamic scenarios.

4. **Output and Evaluation**: The model will predict angular velocities based on the input data, and we'll evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks.

5. **Implementation Details**: Leveraging `slayerPytorch` for the SRM-based SNN components, ensuring that all layers and operations are compatible with the temporal dynamics of spiking networks. We will also ensure that the model handles the multi-channel input effectively by adjusting the network's input layer to accommodate both event data and optical flow.

This approach aims to utilize the rich temporal information from event cameras and motion cues from optical flow, enhancing the model's predictive accuracy and robustness in dynamic environments.


### Architecture Details
Both stages will utilize the same underlying SNN architecture but with different training strategies:

1. **Base Architecture**:
   - **Input Layer**: Adapted to handle both event-based data and optical flow. This might involve separate pathways or combined channels depending on preprocessing steps.
   - **Convolutional Layers**: Several convolutional layers (as per the `cnn_avg_fc1.py` structure) with parameters fine-tuned for spatiotemporal data processing in SRM dynamics.
   - **Pooling Layers**: Spatial and temporal pooling to reduce dimensionality and capture essential features.
   - **Fully Connected Layers**: To map the high-level features to the output, predicting angular velocities.

2. **Stage 1 - Combined Training**:
   - **Data Handling**: Train the network using a mix of event data and optical flow to exploit both spatial features and motion dynamics fully.
   - **Objective**: The model learns to integrate cues from both types of data to predict angular velocities.

3. **Stage 2 - Refinement**:
   - **Data Handling**: Shift the training to use only event data. This stage is designed to refine the model's ability to work with less information and focus more on the inherent capabilities of the event data.
   - **Objective**: Enhance the model's efficiency and adaptability to environments where optical flow might not be available or reliable.

### Refinement Strategy
- **Parameter Freezing**: During the second stage, certain parameters, especially those closely related to optical flow processing, can be frozen to fine-tune the network's response to event data.
- **Incremental Learning**: Gradually increase the emphasis on event data through a curriculum learning approach where the model progressively relies more on event data.

This phased approach allows the network to first leverage the full spectrum of sensory inputs for robust learning and then specialize in a more constrained environment, enhancing adaptability and performance.

### Detailed Refinement Strategy

1. **Parameter Freezing**: In the refinement stage, freezing specific parameters reduces the influence of initially learned features (like those from optical flow) and encourages the network to optimize and rely more heavily on event data. This is akin to using previous knowledge but giving more importance to new sensory inputs under changed conditions.

2. **Incremental Learning**: This involves adjusting the model's exposure to types of data over time. Start with a heavy reliance on both event and optical flow data, then gradually decrease the dependence on optical flow. This method can be seen as a form of "attention shift," where the focus shifts from one type of sensory input to another, improving adaptability and robustness.

### Biological Learning Analogy

In biological systems, particularly in insects and animals, learning often involves adapting behaviors based on a combination of innate instincts and environmental feedback. The refinement strategy is somewhat analogous to this in that it involves:
- **Adapting to changing environments**: Just as animals adjust their behaviors based on environmental changes, the network learns to adjust its reliance on different types of input data.
- **Sensory adaptation**: Animals often rely more heavily on certain senses in different environments (e.g., bats using echolocation in dark environments). Similarly, the network shifts from using a combination of sensors (event and optical flow) to primarily focusing on event data.
We are focusing on incremental changes, since it closely mimics the biological process

### Stage One: Combined Training with Event Data and Optical Flow

For the first stage of the neural network architecture, we will focus on integrating and leveraging both event data and optical flow to train the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Here's how we can structure it:

1. **Input Layer**:
   - **Event Data Input**: This channel will process raw event data (polarity, timestamp, and spatial coordinates) using a voxel grid representation or directly as spike inputs.
   - **Optical Flow Input**: This will process optical flow data converted into a spatiotemporal format suitable for SNN processing.

2. **Feature Extraction Layers**:
   - **Convolutional Layers for Each Input**: Separate convolutional layers will be applied to both event data and optical flow inputs. This helps in extracting relevant features from both types of data independently.
   - **Layer Configurations**: Typical configurations might involve multiple layers with varying numbers of channels, kernel sizes, strides, and padding, optimized for spiking data.

3. **Integration Layer**:
   - **Concatenation/Fusion**: After initial feature extraction, the features from both inputs can be concatenated or fused. This could involve additional spiking layers that integrate these features, allowing the network to learn interactions between the event and optical flow features.

4. **Classification/Regression Layers**:
   - **Dense Spiking Layers**: These layers would process the integrated features to make predictions or classifications based on the combined input data.
   - **Output Specifications**: Depending on the application, the output could be a set of classes (in a classification task) or continuous values (in a regression task like predicting angular velocity).

5. **Training Strategy**:
   - **Loss Functions**: Suitable loss functions need to be defined based on the output. For regression, mean squared error (MSE) could be used, while for classification, a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)-based loss could be implemented.
   - **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**: Given the temporal nature of SNNs, BPTT or similar techniques will be necessary for effective training.

6. **Optimization and Hyperparameters**:
   - **Learning Rates**: Different learning rates for the event and optical flow pathways could be experimented with to balance the learning from both inputs.
   - **Regularization Techniques**: Techniques like dropout or batch normalization adapted for SNNs could be employed to prevent overfitting.

This architecture aims to fully exploit the temporal dynamics and high temporal resolution of event-based sensors, alongside the dense motion information from optical flow, in a manner that's inspired by how biological systems process multisensory information. This stage will set a robust foundation for the network to rely more on event data in the second stage, where optical flow data might be reduced or removed to test adaptability and performance with less information.
